### Profile

Experienced and highly skilled C++ software developer. Particularly interested in software for technical/scientific applications, also in a research and development environment, following the full lifecycle of projects where possible.

Developed applications and utilities that manage high data flows in different environments, like computational fluid dynamics and magnetic resonance imaging; worked with wavelets for image preprocessing and neural networks for image interpretation and data processing, developing my own tools when necessary.
